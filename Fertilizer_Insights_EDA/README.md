📘 Fertilizer Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a fertilizer-related dataset using Python. The goal is to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns in the data using visualizations.

🌱 Project Objective

The purpose of this project is to:

Clean and prepare the dataset

Explore each variable (numerical & categorical)

Understand overall data behaviour

Visualize relationships between different features

Identify outliers, patterns, and correlations

This project is suitable for Data Analysis / EDA learning.

📂 Notebook Workflow (fertilizer_final.ipynb)

⿡ Data Loading

Imported data using Pandas

Viewed sample rows

Checked dataset shape and column types

Displayed missing values

⿢ Data Cleaning

Treated missing values

Handled incorrect or inconsistent entries (if any)

Converted data types where necessary

Removed duplicates

⿣ Exploratory Data Analysis

✔ Univariate Analysis

Histograms

Count plots

Boxplots

Distribution plots

Used to understand:

Feature distribution

Outliers

Skewness / spread

✔ Bivariate Analysis

Scatter plots

Boxplots for numerical vs categorical

Comparisons between key variables

Used to identify:

Trends

Relationships

Group differences

✔ Correlation Analysis

Correlation matrix

Heatmap visualization

Used to check relationships between numerical features.

✔ General Insights

Most frequent fertilizer-related values

How variables vary with each other

Which numerical features are strongly or weakly correlated

📊 Key Visualizations

The notebook contains:

Histogram

Count plot

Boxplot

Scatter plot

Heatmap

All visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
